# Luminated Terra Preta

Terra Preta makeover - now with new, hard-to-miss texture, glow effect and glowing particles (smoke), ideal at night.

This was my first mod for Vintage Story, previously unpublished.
I was tired of never or hardly finding Terra Preta. That was the reason for the creation of this mod.

DasPrinzip had a small mod, Terra Preta Highlighter, which changed the texture. I was now allowed to use this texture for my version. I then added a glow effect for the block ... finished.
Then Craluminum also released a mod, Terra Preta now smoked. I found the idea really great and took it over into my mod.

With the new 1.18 version, some people again had problems finding Terra Preta. So I decided to release this small QoL mod.
